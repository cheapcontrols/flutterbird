			<h1>The Majestic and Beautiful Flutterbird</h1>
			<p>The Flutterbird may be the most important species the world currently inhabitates, yes inhabitates you idiot.
				Sorry for the scientific verbology, by species I obviously mean invertebrate.  The current science shows the
				C02 levels and otomycosis are clearly related.  If we can save the Flutterbird we will both increase and
				decrease the levels of C02 simultaneously.  Therefore we will save, not only, the Flutterbird but also the
				majestic Javelina and the world as we know it.  If not for the efforts of the great, wonderful, and most
				gregarious Dr. S Beakman where would we be?  So, if you are still asking about the importance of the Flutterbird,
				you are as dumb as the idiot Ed Malloy.
