			<h1>WHY HELP?</h1>
			<h3>If you are not a monster then you should be willing to help.</h3>
			<p>
				I want to be clear, saving the Flutterbird is like saving the planet.  We need to do everything possible, 
				even if we destroy the planet in our quest for righteousness.  We must be one with the Flutterbird.  We 
				must be singularly focused in our attempts to combat the existential threat that is imposing and willfully, 
				possibly, belligerently spreading false rumors and false facts about me and my best friend.  But I digress.
				<br/><br/>
				I think the best way to help save the Flutterbird, everyone should send me one-half of their net worth.  
				I know best what to do with your money.  I will spend very little of it on myself.  A nice pair of 
				shoes and a cute top are only the basic requirements to meet the public and spread Flutterbird awareness.  
				A reliable 2022 Jeep Wrangler is a requirement to get to all the locations of possible Flutterbird sightings.  
				Maybe a slightly better apartment with a spare room.  I need a place to display all my trophies and 
				accolades from my youth.  I remember this one time with my father.  We were administering a little 
				retribution on some baby ducks that were trying to invade our personal space and WHAM! This stupid little 
				kid ran his wagon into my fatherâ€™s personal stash.  But I digress.
				<br/><br/>
				Well anyway keep those checks and, better yet, cash donations pouring in.  We will save this incredible 
				planet one chocolate pie at a time!
				<br/><br/>
				Your Friend and superior being<br/><br/>
