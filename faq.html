				<h3 class="question">Do Flutterbirds migrate? </h3>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The migratory patterns of the Flutterbird are hard to determine.  We have found that they 
						move from place to place but it appears to be random.  Gordy spent one week watching a 
						particularly elusive one named Short Stuff.  Gordy is the best type of person and tends 
						to name the Flutterbirds he encounters.  I remember one time there was this missing child 
						and Gordy stepped up to be the first one to ignore that small suffering child to stay in 
						the Flutterbird watch station for the day.  I know my motto is Flutterbirds before babies 
						and it appears Gordy is of a like mind.  Well anyways, he monitored this elusive and flatulent 
						Futterbird for a week and it was determined that the migratory pattern of this tiny bird was 
						random. One morning it was on a fence.  The next morning it was seen on the ground.  Just 
						when a fence-to-ground migratory pattern was being confirmed the ubiquitous fowl was in a  tree.  
						It was as if this particular Flutterbird was mocking my dear friend Gordy.  We will keep studying 
						and keep our valued 4Fs updated.
